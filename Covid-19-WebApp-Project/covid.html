    <h1>COVID-19 </h1>
    <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus. 
        The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.          
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>How it spreads </h2>
    <p>Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
